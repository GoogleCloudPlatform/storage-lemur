## Sample configuration for the S3 data mover plugin.
##
## Set AWS region
# region = "us-east-1"

## Customize the S3 endpoint to use a non-AWS S3 style interface.  The S3
## service must support Auth V4 signed authentication mechanism.
## The default value is the AWS S3 service endpoint for the current
## region or the region the bucket is in, but this can be overridden here.

# endpoint = ""

## Optional access and secret keys for AWS. This is provided for convenience,
## but they can also be provided via the standard environment variables,
##  ~/.aws/credentials, or an IAM Role.

# aws_access_key_id = ""
# aws_secret_access_key = ""


## Maximum number of concurrent copies.
##
# num_threads = 8

##
## One or more archive definition is required.
##
# archive  "s3-test" {
#    id = 2                   # Must be unique to this endpoint
#    bucket = "rmr-hsm-test"  # S3 Bucket used for this archive
#    prefix = "archive"       # Optional prefix
# }
