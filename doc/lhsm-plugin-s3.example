## Sample configuration for the S3 data mover plugin.
##
## The S3 connection options (endpoint and keys) can be specific
## globally or for each archive individually. This allows archives
## to differnt S3 services or just different accounts in the same
## service.
##

## Set AWS region
# region = "us-east-1"

## Customize the S3 endpoint to use a non-AWS S3 style interface.  The S3
## service must support Auth V4 signed authentication mechanism.
## The default value is the AWS S3 service endpoint for the current
## region or the region the bucket is in, but this can be overridden here.

# endpoint = ""

## Optional access and secret keys for AWS. This is provided for convenience,
## but they can also be provided via the standard environment variables,
##  ~/.aws/credentials, or an IAM Role.

# aws_access_key_id = ""
# aws_secret_access_key = ""

## Files larger than this size will be sent using
## multi-part put.

# update_part_size = 5242880


## Maximum number of concurrent copies.
##
# num_threads = 8

##
## One or more archive definition is required.
##
# archive  "s3-test" {
#    id = 2                      # Must be unique to this endpoint
#    endpoint = ""               # Defaults to AWS Endpoints
#    region = "us-east-1"        # Always needs to be set even when
#                                # not using AWS
#    bucket = "test-bucket"      # S3 Bucket used for this archive
#    prefix = "archive"          # Optional prefix
#    aws_access_key_id = ""
#    aws_secret_access_key = ""
#    update_part_size = 5242880  # Size break used for multi-part upload
# }
